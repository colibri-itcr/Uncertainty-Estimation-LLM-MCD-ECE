This study introduces an exploratory analysis of the application of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD),Perplexity, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) techniques to evaluate the uncertainty of generative large language models (LLMs). The investigation focuses on two widely accessible language models, namely Falcon-7B and DistilGPT-2.
